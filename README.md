# Movie-Reviews
This is a demo app to show how to implement: Splash Screen, pagination to an android app (used Paging 3 Library) and Navigation + Safe Args. The data is fetched from a [Movie Reviews API][https://https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/movie-reviews-api/1/overview] which supports pagination.
